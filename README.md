#### Use case: #### 
* If you click any location on the map: 
    validate that this has a real address and itâ€™s not some wood/mountain/ocean, etc. 
* If valid: 
save it to a simple db table with lat, lon, address (can be single string) and also to google fusion tables (decide what data). 

Have a marker appear instantly after the click on the map based on the google fusion table data. 
Update the list of addresses underneath the map with the location where you clicked. 
Duplicates on google fusion table are not allowed. 
You can reset all data on google fusion tables and the database and start fresh
